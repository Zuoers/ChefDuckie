Hello, my name is Zuoers! I've made this bot so people who cant really make discord bots or struggle to start one off are able to use this open source code and customise 
it to there liking! I ask of 1 thing if you do use this project and please join my discord server! Link can be found on my website https://zuoers.dev/
