Discord: https://dsc.gg/Zuxces


Load up terminal and do npm i 

once you've done this all the files should start downloading. 
Do not change Zuxces.js as it will break the bot!

If you're having any issues starting the bot then ping me on our support discord server. https://dsc.gg/Zuxces

However instead of hosting the bot for yourself why not just invite the bot! https://dsc.gg/Zuxces

Anyways once you've downloaded everything needed ete just run node Zuoers.js and the bot should load as long as you done everything correct!

Go to botsettings.json and fill out your bot token and prefix also! Or else the bot wont work for sure xD
